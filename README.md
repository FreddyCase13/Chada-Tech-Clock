"# Chada-Tech-Clock" 

1) This clock app displays a clock in a 12 and 24 hour format. We can also add a second, minute, and hour to it.
This is done via user input in a menu.

2) What was done particularly well was the implimentation of classes so that the main cpp file was programmed efficiently.

3) I could enhance my code by implimenting more methods in the main cpp file in order to make the main code block 
more readable. This would enhance debugging or updating by another developer.

4) The most challenging part of writiing this code was figuring out how to properly impliment methods from classes into
the cpp file correctly. A resource I used was reaching out to my professor for help. Like he always says, if something
is not working the way you want to or if you get stuck, reach out!

5) The skills from this project that will be transferable to all projects I code in the future is using classes, as well
as creating a validator for user input. We defenintely do not want to have invalid user input that can bug a program,
and being able to impliment classes will help with future readability.

6) How I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable was to create classes that uses methods in the main
cpp. This makes reading the main cpp code much easier in order to see how it functions. I also used comments to 
explain what each method does, as well as comments to expalin how the code works. This will allow other developers
to maintain the code if need be.
